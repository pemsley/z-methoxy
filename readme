For many years, off and on, I'd been trying to get autojump to work
with tcsh.  I never managed it.  autojump was useful (for others)
because it remembered the directories that you had visited, so that,
at a later date you could use that information to visit the directory
again using less memory and key strokes.

Recently I heard a review of zoxide on Linux Dev Time (or one of the
Linux After Dark series of podcasts). Intrigued, I also watched
the (excellent) video by Dreams of Autonomy:

I saw that it worked for bash and friends - not really for tcsh.
tcsh was not worth giving up for autojump or zoxide.

So I decided to make a version of autojump/zoxide that works in tcsh.
I mean... how hard can it be?

I wrote it in pure C++-17 - it took a weekend. It worked and I was happy.

One of my colleagues is a fan of Rust - and I decided to write a
program in Rust to see what it was like - so this is that project - a
Rust rewrite of my version of autojump/zoxide.

alias cd  'set zoch3_tmp="$cwd" ; chdir "`z-methoxy \!* | tail -1`" ; setenv OLD_DIR "$zoch3_tmp"'
alias cdi 'set zoch3_tmp="$cwd" ; chdir "`z-methoxy --show-matches \!* | grep -v ^# | fzf | z-methoxy --cut | tail -1`" ; setenv OLD_DIR "$zoch3_tmp"'
